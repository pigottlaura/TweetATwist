- Open the "TweetATwist.pde" file and run the application

### Notes
- Internet is required for this application to run
- By default, each horizontal line of pixels is generated from one frame from the image buffer. To reuse a frame for more than one line (which will increase the speed of the movements on screen, but reduce the quality of the image) use the up/down arrow keys. To reset this to it's original value, press either the left or right arrow key
- To take an image (which will be sent out to the [@TweetATwist2015](https://twitter.com/TweetaTwist2015) Twitter account, and saved in the "Pictures" folder of the Sketch) press the spacebar
- This sketch has also been set up to work with a Targus laser presentation USB remote, so that pictures can be captured without having to be near the computer
- Any tweets containing the hashtag "TweetATwist" (sent from any account) will trigger an image to be taken, and sent back to the user
